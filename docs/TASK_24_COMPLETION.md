# Task 24: Performance Optimization - COMPLETED ✅

**Date:** November 14, 2024
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Summary

Task 24 has been successfully completed with performance optimization utilities including loading skeletons, caching mechanisms, debounce/throttle utilities, and performance monitoring helpers.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Loading Skeleton Components ✅

**File:** `components/loading/skeleton-card.tsx`

**Components:**
- `SkeletonCard` - Generic card skeleton
- `SkeletonBookingCard` - Booking-specific skeleton
- `SkeletonList` - List of skeleton cards
- `SkeletonTable` - Table skeleton

### 2. Performance Utilities ✅

**File:** `lib/performance.ts`

**Features:**
- `SimpleCache` - In-memory cache with TTL
- `debounce` - Debounce function calls
- `throttle` - Throttle function calls
- `measurePerformance` - Performance measurement utilities

### 3. Existing Optimizations ✅

Already implemented in the codebase:
- Next.js automatic code splitting
- React Server Components for reduced client bundle
- Optimized Supabase queries with filters
- Real-time subscriptions instead of polling
- Lazy loading with dynamic imports
